          <div class="collapse answer" id="collapse1">
            <p>Major industry projects require provincial approval and the appropriate permits before development can move forward. This site provides context and access to the multiple layers of authorizations, compliance updates and other items that represent the provincial government’s role as it relates to LNG regulation and oversight.</p>

            <p>This site provides specifics about the provincial government’s role. There are multiple layers of authorizations and approvals the industry must also obtain from the federal government, including a licence to export natural gas overseas.</p> 
            <p>The National Energy Board is Canada’s regulator for the energy industry. More details can be found at the <a href="https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/">www.neb-one.gc.ca</a></p>

            <p>LNG Canada represents the first large-scale export project to announce a final investment decision – an industry term confirming a proposed project is moving forward. The Coastal GasLink pipeline will be built to supply natural gas to the export facility.</p>
            <p>Now that construction is underway, provincial oversight ensures each project is compliant with all government regulations and requirements. This site provides access to the multiple layers of oversight applied to both LNG Canada and Coastal GasLink.</p>
            <p>Other industry projects will be considered for this site moving forward.</p>

          <div class="collapse answer" id="collapse4">
            <p>Natural gas extraction activities, also known as upstream development, is regulated by the BC Oil and Gas Commission.</p>
            <p>The BC Oil and Gas Commission is an independent, single-window regulator for the natural gas industry, overseeing the lifecycle of every project, including exploration, development, consultation, pipeline transportation and reclamation.</p>
            <p>All permitting and oversight authorities are delegated to the BC Oil and Gas Commission through the <a href="http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/08036_01">Oil and Gas Activities Act</a> – British Columbia’s regulatory framework for all oil and gas activities in the province.</p>
            <p>More details about the Commission can be found at <a href="https://www.bcogc.ca/">www.bcogc.ca</a>.</p>

          <div class="collapse answer" id="collapse5">
            <p>There are multiple government agencies involved with regulating workforce accommodations.</p>
            <p>It starts with the environmental assessment process that assesses environmental, economic, health, cultural/heritage and social effects – and that includes workforce accommodations. Conditions can be imposed on a project’s environmental assessment certificate to add specific regulatory requirements related to the workforce. </p>
            <p>The BC Oil and Gas Commission permits the use of Crown Land where the accommodations are built. Northern Health approves construction, food services, drinking water and other necessities. Local governments have a role too by providing permits linked to the BC Building Code – provincial regulation that governs how new constructions are completed.</p>
            <p>Other agencies with a role can include the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, Ministry of Transportation, Technical Safety BC, and WorkSafeBC.</p>

          <div class="collapse answer" id="collapse6">
            <p>The pipeline will only transport raw natural gas. In fact, pipelines built to supply natural gas to a LNG facility in British Columbia can not be converted or permitted to transport other products, including oil and bitumen.</p>
